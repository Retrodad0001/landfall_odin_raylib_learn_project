# Landfall: a simple demo Turn-Based-Strategy game (not done yet)

Created with the ODIN language, Raylib framework and data oriented design mindset for the community and for personal learning

Have fun with it and send me leaning feedback because this is my first game ever made with Odin and Raylib
